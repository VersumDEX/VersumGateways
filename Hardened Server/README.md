**Deployment:**

1. Install all daemons (Multichain, Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin) & confire their RPC API

2. Give admin rights to Multichain Node

3. Edit conf.py with the neccessary information

4. Launch all workers one by one




**NOTE: This is code is by far not ready for deployment. We're currently testing the gateways on the different testnets (you can see it in our tutorial video HERE), and working hard to make them ready for real usage.**
